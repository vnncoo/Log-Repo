Took my time off and enjoyed New Year since my PC is still broken. 
Still sad since I broke my 3 months of consistent git commits,
but is definitely planning to return with a stronger streak.

Finished setting up the laptop I borrowed from my cousin. 
and I also finished refreshing my brain with CS50x's lesson. 
Hopefully could continue where I left off tomorrow.

So today my cousin will take his laptop back,
I own the ssd that's on the laptop at the moment since his hdd is kind of slow.
I will be reverting the current win10 to 7 though since my HP Pavillion doesn't have a driver for win10

Genuinely struggling without a laptop, 
I'm still watching a few videos every now and then but 
I don't feel like coding using a phone.
Not to mention the difficulty of using cs50's version of vscode... 
it's tough. But I have a few plans brewing, hopefully it works out:>
